# Plotting — Roadmap

A macOS SwiftUI app for analyst review of clinical findings produced upstream
by a cluster of analysis machines (VF/VT onset, AFib, PVCs, disease vectors).
The PhysioNet WFDB record (`.hea` + `.dat`) is the *context* the analyst
needs to interpret each finding; the findings themselves are the primary
data surface.

## Current state (updated 2026-06-17)

**Bedside layout**
- `LeadChipBar` across the top of `BedsideView` with a per-lead color chip
  and a Focus / Strips segmented control. Focus mode shows a single tall
  panel for the selected lead; Strips mode stacks every lead vertically.
- `RecordContextPanel` — top-of-view summary block that surfaces `.hea`
  header comments (recovered from the original WFDB file) and a Markdown
  `notes.md` editor that lives next to the recording bundle.
- Read/write latch toolbar toggle (lock / lock.open) gates notes editing
  and is wired to gate future annotation create/edit/delete affordances.
- Window adaptability: narrower sidebar (160 pt min), narrower inspector
  (220 pt min), wrapped summary text, and a reduced canvas minimum so the
  app collapses cleanly to a small window.

**Annotation model (the wow factor)**
- `Annotation` — `kind` (point/range), `category`, optional `label`,
  `confidence`, `severity` (info/notice/warning/critical, Comparable),
  `source`, optional `note`, `lead`, `evidenceContextSeconds`.
- `AnnotationFile` JSON wire format (`schemaVersion: 1`) is the canonical
  ingest path. Timestamps accept either `startSample`/`endSample` (already
  aligned) or `startUnixMS`/`endUnixMS` (viewer resolves at import).
- WFDB `.atr` is a legacy adapter — beat letters become point annotations
  tagged `source = "wfdb.atr"`.
- Importer scans `<recordName>.annotations.json` first, then `.atr`/`.qrs`,
  concatenating both.
- `Recording` decode is back-compat: legacy manifests with
  `[WFDBAnnotation]` arrays still load and get adapted on the fly.

**Findings UI**
- Right-side `inspector` drawer (`FindingsPanel`) with filter chip bar:
  categories (each with its palette color dot), severities, sources, and
  a confidence-threshold slider.
- Findings list — color-grouped rows with time, severity badge, confidence,
  source, and note preview. Click to jump the viewport; range findings
  widen the viewport to show context around them.
- The filter is shared with the canvas — filtered-out findings stop
  rendering everywhere.
- `CategoryPalette` — hand-tuned colors for common clinical categories
  (reds = ventricular, purples = atrial, blues = conduction, slate =
  noise), with deterministic FNV-1a → HSV fallback for unknown categories.

**Waveform Canvas — Metal**
- `MTKView` via `NSViewRepresentable`. Per-frame: clear paper → range fills
  (one bucket per category) → grid minor → grid major → grid landmark →
  trace OR pyramid envelope → point rules (one bucket per category).
- Shaders: `traceVertex`, `lineVertex`, `envelopeVertex`, `rangeVertex`,
  `colorFragment`. Trace is now a triangle-strip polyline — each sample
  extrudes to a 2-vertex ribbon and the vertex shader computes the
  perpendicular in screen-pixel space, so line width stays constant in
  points regardless of zoom (Metal has no `glLineWidth` equivalent).
- Annotation buckets group by `(category, kind)` so each category gets its
  own color in a single instanced draw call. Severity modulates alpha.
- SwiftUI overlays for axis tick labels (time + mV), annotation symbol
  text, and an off-scale chevron overlay driven by `ClippedRangeScanner`
  (▲/▼ markers at the canvas edge where the signal clipped above/below).
- Overview ribbon stays Swift Charts — tiny widget, click/drag scrub.

**Data engine**
- `BinaryRecordingFile` v2 — 64-byte header + packed Float32 body.
- `MappedSampleAccess` + `PyramidLevelFile` — mmap-backed reads.
- `PyramidBuilder` — single-pass cascading min/max bins (stride 10, up to
  6 levels).
- `ChannelView` — LOD-aware reader; `selectLevel(samplesPerPixel:)` returns
  raw or the deepest fitting pyramid level.
- `RecordingViewport` (`@Observable @MainActor`) — shared time window for
  every lead, with `pan` / `setStart` / `setWidth` / `jump` clamped to
  bounds and a 100 ms minimum window.

**Ingest + sandbox**
- File picker selects a *folder*; security scope covers all files inside.
- `WFDBHeaderParser` supports format 16 and 212 (MIT-BIH style); baseline
  defaults to `adcZero` per WFDB spec.
- `RecordingStore` async import on background task; per-record import cache
  in `ContentView` so switching records is instant after first import.

**ECG paper grid**
- `ECGGridSpec.forDuration(seconds:)` picks adaptive minor / major /
  landmark spacings per zoom level so the grid stays readable from 1 s to
  multi-hour windows. Landmark is always 5× the major — the "1 s / 2.5 mV"
  reference line on standard ECG paper.

**Ingest extras**
- `WFDBHeaderParser` preserves `#`-prefixed comment lines verbatim and
  threads them through the importer onto `Recording.headerComments`.
- `WFDBImporter` copies any sibling `notes.md` from the source folder into
  the imported bundle and records its filename on the manifest so the
  context panel can read/write it.

**Tests** — 83 total (79 unit + 4 UI).

## Architecture

Three layers as agreed; all three now built:

1. **Data Engine** — mmap + pyramid + LOD selector + viewport.
2. **Waveform Canvas** — Metal (MTKView) rendering paper, grid, trace,
   envelope, point + range annotations.
3. **Control Overlay** — SwiftUI for axes, annotation symbols, gestures,
   findings panel, filter chips, toolbar.

## Next goals

### Near-term (next session)
- [ ] "Attach findings…" toolbar action — pick a JSON from anywhere and
      merge into the current recording's annotations (currently ingest is
      folder-scan only)
- [ ] Persist annotations separately from `recording.json` as
      `annotations.json` so re-running the analysis cluster doesn't require
      re-importing the .dat samples
- [ ] Schema versioning — write a deliverable `schema.md` in the repo so
      cluster producers have a stable contract
- [ ] Mini-timeline ticks under each channel overview ribbon — colored
      dots at every annotation's fractional position so beat density and
      finding clusters are visible at full-recording scale
- [ ] Hover tooltips on the canvas — hit-test for the nearest finding and
      show its full note + confidence + source

### Medium-term
- [ ] Lead-specific findings — render annotations only on the channels
      that match their `lead` field
- [ ] Finding sorting modes (by time, by category, by confidence, by
      severity) in the findings panel
- [ ] Keyboard navigation: J/K through findings, →/← pan one window,
      +/− zoom
- [ ] Per-channel y-axis autoscale (instead of fixed ±5 mV) when the
      signal sits in a narrower band
- [ ] Beat clustering at low zoom — collapse adjacent points of the same
      category into a single hit-counter mark when they overlap
- [ ] Snapshot export — current viewport as PNG with grid + findings, for
      sharing with clinicians

### Deferred
- [ ] Multi-file WFDB records (per-signal `.dat`)
- [ ] Additional WFDB sample formats (8, 16+, 24, 32, 310, 311, 80)
- [ ] Annotation authoring inside the app (manual marker placement)
- [ ] Export imported recordings to a portable bundle
- [ ] HDR/wide-color-gamut Metal canvas
- [ ] Two-finger trackpad swipe → pan via an NSScrollView bridge
