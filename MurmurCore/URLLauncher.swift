//
//  URLLauncher.swift
//  MurmurCore
//
//  Indirection layer around `NSWorkspace.shared.open(_:)` so URL launches from
//  Help menu commands and welcome-screen links can be intercepted by UI tests.
//  Production behavior: open the URL via NSWorkspace (browser, mail client,
//  whatever the system has registered for the scheme).
//
//  Under `--ui-test-record-urls`: don't open anything; record the URL on
//  `lastLaunchedURL`. A hidden accessibility element mounted in `ContentView`
//  echoes the URL string into the test runner, letting XCUI assert "the
//  Privacy Policy menu item targets the right URL" without the test process
//  launching a browser and losing focus.
//
//  This is a deliberate seam, not a full DI layer — the launcher is a global
//  singleton so menu commands and SwiftUI links can call into it without
//  threading instances down the view tree. Tests rely on the singleton.
