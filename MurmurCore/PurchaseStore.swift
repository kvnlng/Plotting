//
//  PurchaseStore.swift
//  MurmurCore
//
//  Entitlement state for the three planned in-app purchases that gate
//  the paid extension frameworks (Annotation Authoring, ECG Metrics,
//  VT Detection). The free viewer + the synthetic test producer never
//  need to consult this store — `canRun(producerID:)` returns true for
//  free producers by design.
//
//  Phase 1 (StoreKit 2): products fetched via `Product.products(for:)`
//  on init; ownership tracked via `Transaction.currentEntitlements`
//  (initial state) and a long-running listener on `Transaction.updates`
//  (purchases / restores / refunds). Unverified transactions are
//  refused — we only grant entitlements off cryptographically verified
//  transactions per Apple's sample-code pattern.
//
//  Surface is `public` so the paid framework targets (MurmurAnnotation,
//  MurmurMetrics, MurmurInference — pulling MurmurCore as an SPM dep)
//  can call `PurchaseStore.shared.owns(...)` from their own bundles.
