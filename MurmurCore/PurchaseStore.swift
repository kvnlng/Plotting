//
//  PurchaseStore.swift
//  MurmurCore
//
//  Entitlement state for the three planned in-app purchases that gate
//  the paid extension frameworks (Annotation Authoring, Silver Layer
//  Metrics, VT Detection). The free viewer + the synthetic test
//  producer never need to consult this store — `canRun(producerID:)`
//  returns true for free producers by design.
//
//  Scope today (Phase 0): the surface + the producer-to-product
//  mapping. The actual StoreKit 2 wiring (Product.products(for:),
//  Transaction.updates, AppStore.sync()) lands in Phase 1 alongside
//  the App Store Connect product registrations. Until then,
//  `ownedProductIDs` stays empty in RELEASE and tests pin the mapping.
//
//  Surface is `public` so the paid framework targets (MurmurAnnotation,
//  MurmurSilver, MurmurInference — pulling MurmurCore as an SPM dep)
//  can call `PurchaseStore.shared.owns(...)` from their own bundles.
