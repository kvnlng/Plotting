//  FindingProducer.swift
//  MurmurCore
//
//  The runtime contract between the free open-source viewer (MurmurCore)
//  and the paid extension frameworks (MurmurAnnotation, MurmurMetrics,
//  MurmurInference). Every framework that examines a Recording and emits
//  Annotations conforms to this protocol. The host (BedsideView /
//  FindingsPanel) discovers conforming types via `ProducerRegistry` and
//  drives them through a uniform UI surface — progress bars, cancel
//  buttons, error reporting — regardless of whether the producer is a
//  deterministic Swift port, a Core ML model, or a synthetic fixture.
//
//  Design decisions captured 2026-06-29 (see ROADMAP "Phase 0"):
//
//   • Async over sync. ML inference is heavy; we don't want a sync→async
//     migration later.
//   • Output = AsyncThrowingStream of events, not a single returned
//     `[Annotation]`. The stream interleaves progress reports, batched
//     findings, and per-window warnings, so the UI can show partial
//     results as scanning advances rather than waiting for a single
//     terminal value.
//   • Cancellation is the caller's responsibility — `for try await event
//     in stream` honors Task cancellation naturally, and the producer
//     MUST call `try Task.checkCancellation()` on window boundaries.
//   • Per-window failures emit `.warning` events; the run continues.
//     Only a fully-irrecoverable error throws and terminates the stream.
//   • Confidence calibration is the producer's responsibility. The
//     `Annotation.confidence` field is documented as already calibrated
//     (Platt-scaled or equivalent); hosts treat it as comparable across
//     producers.
//   • Producer discovery via `ProducerRegistry` actor — IAP gating is
//     enforced at the call site by filtering the registry against
//     `PurchaseStore` entitlements; the registry itself is unaware of
//     entitlements.
//
//  Public surface (audited in B2 of the open-core SPM split): the
//  protocol, `ProducerEvent`, `ProgressUpdate`, and `ProducerRegistry`
//  are all `public`, along with `Annotation`, `Recording`, `Channel`,
//  and `PurchaseStore.ProductID`. That's the conservative cut that
//  lets an out-of-module conformer (paid framework or third-party)
//  construct findings and register them. Sample-reader internals
//  (MappedSampleAccess, ChannelView, etc.) remain internal until a
//  paid framework demonstrates a need.
