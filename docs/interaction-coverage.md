# Interaction coverage

A catalog of every analyst-facing interaction Murmur Studio supports, with
its test status. Treat this as the source of truth for "have we proven this
flow works?" — code coverage tells us we exercised the lines, but only this
tells us we exercised the *meaningful actions*.

The smoke-test checklist in `RELEASE.md` is a manual subset of this list,
covering the highest-risk flows before each public submission.

**Legend**
- ✅ Automated test in `MurmurUITests/` or `MurmurTests/`
- 🟡 Manual gate via the `RELEASE.md` smoke pass
- ⬜ Uncovered — no automated test, not in smoke pass

**Current score:** 6 ✅ automated · 22 🟡 manual-only · 1 ⬜ uncovered out of 29 total.
That's **21% automated**, **97% covered by some gate** (automated + smoke).

The North Star: convert 🟡 → ✅ over time, especially for flows where the
bug class would silently degrade the analyst experience without crashing.
Update this table whenever a new interaction is added, a flow becomes
automated, or one moves between buckets.

## Welcome / first-run

| Interaction | Test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Empty-state prompt visible on cold launch | ✅ `MurmurUITests/testEmptyStateIsVisible` | |
| Toolbar **Open** button exists on cold launch | ✅ `MurmurUITests/testToolbarOpenButtonExists` | |
| Click "Try a sample recording" → synthetic fixture loads, bedside renders | ✅ `MurmurUITests/testSyntheticFixtureRendersBedsideView` | Asserts `bedside-view`, `lead-chip-bar`, `channel-panel-I` present and `empty-state-prompt` gone |
| Click "Open Record Folder" → fileImporter opens, folder selection loads | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | `fileImporter` flows are XCUI-hostile on macOS — modal sheet escapes the test runner |
| Click a recent-folder row → folder re-opens | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | `welcome-recent-*` identifier exists; would need a launch-arg primer to seed UserDefaults with a recents entry |
| Drag-and-drop a folder onto the welcome view → opens | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | `DropDelegate` invocation can't be synthesised by XCUI |
| Click PhysioNet link → opens browser | ⬜ Uncovered | URL launch leaves the test runner; low-value to automate |

## Canvas / waveform interaction

| Interaction | Test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drag pan canvas → viewport advances by translation distance | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | XCUI `press(forDuration:thenDragTo:)` doesn't emit `NSEvent.mouseDragged`, so `DragGesture` never fires. Viewport pan math covered by `RecordingViewportTests/panClampsLeft` and siblings. |
| Pinch zoom canvas → viewport width scales | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | `MagnifyGesture` not synthesisable from XCUI on macOS. Zoom math covered by `RecordingViewportTests/setWidth*` |
| Hover canvas → crosshair appears at cursor | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Hover state doesn't appear in XCUI accessibility tree even with `--ui-test-hover-at=X,Y` injection. Hit-test math covered by unit tests |
| Click finding row → viewport animates to finding | ✅ `MurmurUITests/testClickingFindingRowChangesViewport` | Uses `ui-test-viewport-state` accessibility element to read pre/post state |
| Click overview ribbon → viewport scrubs to clicked position | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `overview-ribbon-*` exists; would compose like the finding-row test but distinct gesture |
| Click on density-timeline lane → viewport jumps to fraction | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `density-lane-*` exists |
| Renderer produces non-blank output | ✅ `WaveformRendererDrawSceneTests/clearsToPaperPink` + `drawsTraceWhenSamplesLoaded` | Offscreen MTLTexture readback — catches the bundle-lookup / shader-compile / pipeline-state class of bug |

## Layout controls

| Interaction | Test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Click lead chip → focus mode shifts to that lead | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `lead-chip-*` exists |
| Toggle Focus / Strips layout mode | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `layout-mode-*` exists |

## Toolbar

| Interaction | Test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Toolbar **Open** button → fileImporter opens | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | See "Open Record Folder" — same modal-sheet limit |
| Toolbar **Findings** toggle → side panel shows/hides | ✅ `MurmurUITests/testFindingsPanelTogglesViaToolbar` | Toggles `findings-toggle`, verifies `finding-row-*` appears/disappears |
| Toolbar **Edit mode** latch → unlocks editing surfaces | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `edit-mode-toggle`. The lock-gated actions below all depend on this latch |
| Toolbar **Attach findings…** → file picker for sidecar JSON | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `attach-findings`. Modal-sheet limit again |

## Findings ops (lock-gated)

| Interaction | Test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Filter by category via summary chip | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `summary-chip-*` exists. Filter math covered by `FindingFilterTests` |
| Confirm a finding (with edit-mode latch) | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `disposition-confirm-*` exists. Disposition state covered by `DispositionStoreTests` |
| Dismiss a finding (with edit-mode latch) | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `disposition-dismiss-*` exists |
| Reset a finding to unreviewed (with edit-mode latch) | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `disposition-reset-*` exists |
| Edit a finding's note in context panel | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `context-notes-editor` exists |

## Strips (low-rate trends)

| Interaction | Test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Click alarm-strip lane → viewport jumps to occurrence | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `alarm-lane-*` exists |
| Click quality-strip lane → viewport jumps to occurrence | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `quality-lane-*` exists |
| Click state-backdrop-strip lane → viewport jumps | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | Identifier `state-backdrop-strip` exists |

## Window / menu

| Interaction | Test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Window respects min 1100×720 bound | ✅ `MurmurUITests/testWindowHonorsMinimumSize` | Catches the App Store Guideline 4 rejection scenario |
| Help → Murmur Studio Help → opens `kvnlng.github.io/Murmur` | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | `NSWorkspace.shared.open` leaves the runner |
| Help → Getting Started | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | |
| Help → Annotation Schema | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | |
| Help → Privacy Policy | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | |
| Help → Contact Support… | 🟡 RELEASE.md smoke | `mailto:` link |

## Gaps to close (priority order)

1. **Click overview ribbon → viewport scrubs.** Same shape as the
   finding-row test we already have — high-value, low-cost to write.
2. **Click summary chip → filter applies.** Identifier already exists.
   Compose against the findings list to verify filter took effect.
3. **Lock-gated confirm/dismiss/reset round-trip.** Toggle edit-mode
   latch, hit confirm, assert disposition state shows in the row.
   Replaces three smoke steps with one XCUI test.

Each of these reads as one focused XCUI test. Together they'd raise
automated coverage from 21% → ~38%.

## Counted intentionally NOT in this list

- File-format edge cases (multi-file WFDB, etc.) — those are data
  coverage, not interaction coverage. Tested by `WFDBHeaderParserTests` etc.
- Async / progress UI during recording import — invisible to analyst
  steady-state; covered by `RecordingStoreTests`
- Snapshot-tested visual states (tooltips, axes, density timeline) —
  visual coverage, separate dimension. See `SnapshotTests`.
- Metal canvas pixel-level rendering — visual coverage; intentionally
  not snapshot-tested (GPU diff unreliable). Renderer-level coverage
  via `WaveformRendererDrawSceneTests`.
