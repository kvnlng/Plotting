# Murmur

A macOS SwiftUI app for analyst review of clinical ECG findings over
PhysioNet WFDB recordings.

Findings come from an upstream cluster of analysis machines (VF/VT onset,
AFib, PVCs, disease vectors). The WFDB trace is the *context* an analyst
needs to interpret each finding — Murmur renders it as a Metal-backed
ECG paper canvas with the cluster's findings overlaid.

## What's here

- **[Getting started]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started)** — open a
  record, jump to a finding, scrub the timeline.
- **[Architecture]({{ site.baseurl }}/architecture)** — the three-layer
  Data Engine / Waveform Canvas / Control Overlay split and the key
  invariants.
- **[Annotation JSON schema]({{ site.baseurl }}/annotation-schema)** —
  what the producer cluster emits as `<recordName>.annotations.json`.
- **[Performance notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/performance)** — how the
  pyramid + LOD selector + zero-copy GPU buffers keep pan/zoom smooth on
  multi-hour records.
- **[Roadmap](https://github.com/kvnlng/Murmur/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)**
  — current state and what's next.

## At a glance

![Murmur bedside view — record sidebar on the left, Metal-backed ECG paper canvas in the middle with the focused MLII lead and three-tier grid, and the findings inspector on the right.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bedside-overview.png)

Three columns: the record sidebar on the left, the bedside canvas in the
middle (lead chip bar + record-context header + Metal-backed ECG paper +
overview ribbon), and the findings inspector on the right. Drag the
chart to pan; pinch to zoom; click the ribbon to scrub. All channels in
a record share the viewport so leads stay time-locked.
